# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple Python script that evaluates the strength of a given password based on common security criteria. It helps users create strong passwords by providing detailed feedback and improvement suggestions.

## 🚀 Features

- Checks for:
  - Minimum length (8 characters)
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character (e.g. `!@#$%^&*`)
- Provides a strength rating from **Extremely Weak** to **Very Strong**
- Gives suggestions to improve weak passwords

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed except Python's built-in `re` module (for regex).

## 📄 How to Use

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.

2. **Run the script** using Python:

   ```bash
   python password_strength_checker.py
````

3. **Enter your password** when prompted, and the tool will assess its strength and suggest improvements.

## 🧠 Example Output

Enter a password to check its strength: Pass123

Password Strength: Moderate 🟡
Suggestions to improve:
- Include at least one special character (!@#$%^&* etc.).
```
