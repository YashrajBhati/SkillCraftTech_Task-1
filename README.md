# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Encryption & Decryption

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** — one of the earliest known and simplest encryption techniques. It shifts each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## 📜 Features

- Encrypts any message with a given shift
- Decrypts encrypted messages using the same shift
- Preserves spaces, punctuation, and numbers
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the position of each letter in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- `X` becomes `A`, etc.

To decrypt, the letters are shifted **back** by the same amount.

## 🖥️ Usage

### Example
### 🔧 Requirements
Enter your message: Hello World!
Enter shift value (number): 3

🔐 Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog!
🔓 Decrypted Message: Hello World!

- Python 3.x

### ▶️ Run the Script

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
